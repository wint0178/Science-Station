# Modular and Open-Source Science Station
The Modular and Open-Source Science Station (MOSSS) features a decentralized 
environmental monitoring network designed for rugged, remote terrain. Utilizing 
a localized LoRaWAN mesh alongside EcoWitt meteorological sensors, the system 
aggregates real-time microclimate data, barometric pressure, and physical 
movement tracking. 

At the core of the MOSSS physical tracking infrastructure is the WOILD 
(Wireless Sensor Network for Real-Time Landslide Detection) subsystem—an 
open-source hardware and telemetry framework specifically engineered to monitor 
slope stability and ground acceleration. 

All data streams converge on a centrally located, local Home Assistant Core 
gateway, which orchestrates automated mobile alerts via custom vector 
deviation matrices and seamlessly bridges the network into broader smart 
integrations.

## 🛠️ Hardware Stack

| Layer | Device | Sensors / Specs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Field Nodes** | Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 | MPU6050 Accelerometer, DHT22, 1W Solar |
| **Weather** | EcoWitt WN90 Array | Piezo Rain, Anemometer, Temp/Humid/Pres |
| **Gateways** | SenseCAP M2 & EcoWitt GW3001 | LoRaWAN (TTN), WiFi |
| **Core Gateway**| Raspberry Pi 4 | 32GB mSD, Home Assistant Core, Nabu Casa |

## 🔄 How It Works (Data Pipeline)
1. **Telemetry Collection:** Solar-powered LoRa nodes monitor environmental metrics and structural movement on the hillsides.
2. **Backhaul:** Data is pushed via LoRaWAN to the SenseCAP gateway (integrated with TTN), while weather data routes through the EcoWitt gateway.
3. **Processing & Action:** Home Assistant Core ingests all streams, handles local logic to control smart infrastructure in the valley, and pushes automated alerts to mobile clients.
